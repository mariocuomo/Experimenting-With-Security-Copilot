# Experimenting With Security Copilot

This repository contains some experiments I have done with Security Copilot in creating custom plugins, automations and promptbooks.

- [Custom Plugins](https://github.com/mariocuomo/Experimenting-With-Security-Copilot/tree/main/custom%20plugins)
- [Logic App Connector](https://github.com/mariocuomo/Experimenting-With-Security-Copilot/tree/main/automations)
- [Promptbooks](https://github.com/mariocuomo/Experimenting-With-Security-Copilot/tree/main/promptbooks)


> [!NOTE]  
> This Repository is as-is. <br> It is **not the official Security Copilot repository** and is n**ot officially maintained by Microsoft**. It is my own experiments with it and the goal is to **evangelize the adoption** and capabilities of the product.
