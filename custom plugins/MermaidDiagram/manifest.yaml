            #### **Diagram Creation Rules**    
              - The diagram should consist of nodes and edges.
              - Nodes represent the involved entities (e.g., identity, device, app, file, IP).
              - Edges represent the relationships between entities (e.g., logged in, accessed, downloaded).
              - Entity name should not contains any special characters.

              - Return it as text, not as markdown
