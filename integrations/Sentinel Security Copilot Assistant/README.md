<a name="WHAT"></a>
**Sentinel Security Copilot Assistant (SSCA)** is a collection of robust playbooks designed to seamlessly integrate Microsoft Security Copilot with Microsoft Sentinel. By leveraging the power of AI-driven insights and automation, SSCA enhances security operations by enabling capabilities such as entity enrichment, incident summarization, and more.

**ðŸ“Œ Key Features**
- **Entity Lookup**: Quickly retrieve and enrich information about IPs, domains, users, and devices, streamlining investigation workflows.
- **Incident Summary**: Generate both brief and expanded summaries of incidents, providing clear and actionable insights for security teams.
- **Scheduled Updates**: Deliver regular updates on incident situations, Microsoft Sentinel's health, and SOC efficiency metrics, keeping your team informed and proactive.

**ðŸ›  Prerequisites** <br>
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A valid **Microsoft Sentinel** instance.
- Access to **Microsoft Security Copilot**.
- Necessary permissions to configure and run Sentinel playbooks.

# Schema

The SSCA solution deploys several Azure Logic Apps, categorized by their intended functionality. <br>
Below is a description of each resource. <br>

### Entity Lookup <br>
These Logic Apps are designed to enrich security investigations by providing detailed information about specific entities and posted them as Sentinel incident Comment.
- **SSCA-IPLookupComment** <br>
Enriches incident investigations with contextual information about IP addresses (e.g., geolocation, threat intelligence).
- **SSCA-DomainLookupComment** <br>
Retrieves data about domains, such as reputation, WHOIS details, and DNS information.
- **SSCA-UserLookupComment** <br>
Provides insights into user activities and account-related data for faster security triage.
- **SSCA-DeviceLookupComment** <br>
Supplies detailed device-related information, including device compliance, vulnerabilities, and configuration.

### Incident Summary
These Logic Apps generate concise and comprehensive summaries for security incidents to improve situational awareness and post the summary as Sentinel incident comment.
- **SSCA-IncidentSummary-Brief** <br>
Creates a quick, high-level summary of incidents for immediate insights and faster decision-making.
- **SSCA-IncidentSummary-Expanded** <br>
Produces a detailed, in-depth summary of incidents, including key findings and recommendations.

### Scheduled Updates
These Logic Apps deliver periodic reports and summaries to keep security teams informed about various operational metrics via email.
- **SSCA-IncidentsSituationEmail** <br>
Sends a scheduled overview of the current incident situation, highlighting trends and unresolved cases.
- **SSCA-SentinelHealthEmail** <br>
Provides updates on the health status of Microsoft Sentinel to ensure continued optimal performance.
- **SSCA-SOCOptimizationEmail** <br>
Reports on SOC efficiency metrics, offering insights into workflow optimization and performance improvements.

# Deploy
<a name="DEPLOY"></a>
The SSCA solution provides flexibility in deployment, allowing you to either deploy each Logic App individually or deploy them all together as a comprehensive solution.

### Deployment Options
- **Individual Deployment**: Each Logic App can be deployed separately based on your specific needs and priorities.
- **Complete Deployment**: Deploy the entire suite of Logic Apps at once for seamless integration and full functionality.

### Deployment Instructions
1. **Deploy Individually**
   - Navigate to the Logic App folder of your choice (e.g., entity-lookup, incident-summary, scheduled-updates).
   - Use the provided **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template** to deploy the specific Logic App.
   
2. **Deploy All at Once**
   - Use the main **ARM template** to deploy all Logic Apps together for complete SSCA functionality.
