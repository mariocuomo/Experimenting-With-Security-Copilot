There are at least 3 good reasons to interact with Azure Open AI with a custom plugin:
- **Context (PAST)** <br>
In the natural language prompt, you can reference past information and reference session context. See the custom incident report custom plugin.
- **Context (Future)** <br>
The GPT response can be used by subsequent prompts.
- **Easy to do** <br>
The integration is ready, there is no need to create your own Azure OpenAI instance, define access, do auditing, etc.


## Logic App
