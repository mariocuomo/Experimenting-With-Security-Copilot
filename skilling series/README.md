# Skilling Series

This folder contains templates of custom plugins and automations for the **Microsoft Security Copilot Champs**. They are intended to demonstrate the different plugins that can be created in Security Copilot. They are not advanced use cases.

> [!NOTE]  
> This Repository is as-is. <br> It is **not the official Security Copilot repository** and is **not officially maintained by Microsoft**. It is my own experiments with it and the goal is to **evangelize the adoption** and capabilities of the product.
